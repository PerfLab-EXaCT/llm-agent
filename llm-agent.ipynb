We use LLM API calls to prompt the LLM into providing information about the code at regular intervals (currently set at each save instance). Examples of the provided information include but are not limited to the existence of a high degree of thread divergence, too many accesses to global memory, and low computation intensity. Once the LLM detects these issues, it is then prompted to suggest fixes that solve individual issues.\\nThe LLM then provides the suggestions as diff files that are passed to the user via the IDE's front-end features. The user may choose to accept or reject the suggestions as shown in Figure 1. The list of recommendations and solutions that have currently been tested are listed below.\",\n",
